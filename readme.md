# 🧭 OFSC Plugin for Inventory Management

## 📦 Overview
Oracle Field Service Cloud (OFSC) does not provide a complete built-in user interface for managing **on-hand inventory** at the resource (technician) level.  
To address this limitation, the **OFSC Plugin for Inventory Management** provides an easy-to-use, configurable UI that allows dispatchers and resource managers to **view, update, and delete inventory items** directly within OFSC.

This plugin is ready to use — you just need to configure it in your OFSC environment.

✅ **Delete All Inventory** — Clear all on-hand inventory items for a resource.  
✅ **Get Resource Details** — Retrieve basic details of a technician or resource.
